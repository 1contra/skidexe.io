# Skidexe.io
Skidexe.io is an open source recreation of a few web games (scenexe, diep, arras)

any help is appreciated
if anyone wants to work on the websocket protocol we need to use Unit8Array instead of json because the performance is messed up

### This is work in progress and not fully ready for production.

## Running locally

start game with with `pnpm dev`

the game is at [http://127.0.0.1:3000]

## Usimg commands

type `/1234` to gain admin access

right now we only have /polygon

you can use `/polygon {sides} {radiance ammount (min 0, max 20)}`
so for example `/polygon 8 10` spawns a radiant 10 octagon
